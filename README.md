# PCB Vibration and Thermal Tester

## Overview
In industry, vibration/thermal testing involves simulating real-world conditions where a system is subjected to simultaneous temperature and vibration changes. This project involves developing a custom test setup where we can simulate these conditions in a controlled, reproducible environment.
